# Client â€” Task Tracker

This README is the client-specific companion to the repository's root `README.md`.

Quick start (see root `README.md` for repo-wide quick start):

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

For client-specific scripts and advanced CRA guidance, keep this file as the place to document frontend developer notes.
